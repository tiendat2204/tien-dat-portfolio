# Unforgettable Memories: Da Nang - Hoi An - Quang Nam Journey with TA Consultant

There are trips that go beyond mere relaxation, leaving deep imprints in everyone's hearts about camaraderie and the meaning of sharing. TA Consultant's journey to Da Nang - Hoi An - Quang Nam was exactly one of those meaningful trips.

## The Journey Begins with People

As part of the developer team at TA Consultant, I always feel fortunate to work alongside talented and passionate individuals. But only when we step outside our familiar workspace do we truly understand the value of each team member.

From frontend and backend developers to designers, testers, and the management team - everyone comes together as a united collective, ready to explore new experiences together.

## Da Nang - Where Ocean Meets Technology

Our first destination took us to the coastal city of Da Nang. After long days of coding and debugging, standing before the vast ocean, feeling the salty breeze and hearing the waves crash against the shore was truly a wonderful experience.

### Memorable Moments in Da Nang

- **Sunrise at My Khe Beach**: The entire team woke up early to watch the sunrise over the ocean. There's something special about people who regularly work with blue screen light coming together to welcome the golden sunlight.

- **Team building activities**: Beach activities not only helped everyone relax but also strengthened team spirit. From simple games to creative competitions, everything brought joyful laughter.

- **Dragon Bridge and walking street**: Exploring the city at night with modern architectural works reminded us of the development of technology and society.

## Hoi An - Where Time Stands Still

If Da Nang brought modernity and dynamism, Hoi An took us back to a peaceful, ancient space. This is where the entire team could truly relax and enjoy moments of tranquility.

### Unforgettable Experiences in the Ancient Town

**Hoi An Lantern Night**: Nothing can compare to the feeling of walking through ancient streets illuminated by thousands of colorful lanterns. Our developer team, who regularly work with colors on screens, were truly amazed by this real-world beauty.

**Releasing flower lanterns on Hoai River**: A meaningful activity where each team member wrote good wishes for each other and the company. The small flower lanterns floating along the water seemed to carry our dreams and hopes.

**Street food**: From cao lau, mi Quang to Phuong bread - each dish created lively conversations among members. This was also when people shared more about their personal lives, creating stronger bonds.

## Quang Nam - A Meaningful Journey

The final leg of our journey took us to Quang Nam, where TA Consultant carried out extremely meaningful activities - giving gifts to families with elderly people living alone and those suffering from illness.

### Heart-touching Moments

Nothing can describe the emotions of the entire team when witnessing the sincere smiles of elderly people and sick family members when receiving gifts. From daily necessities, food to medical supplies - each gift contained the love and care of all TA Consultant employees.

Witnessing difficult circumstances yet remaining optimistic, we learned to cherish what we have and always be grateful for our current lives.

This trip was not just a simple tourism activity but also clearly demonstrated TA Consultant's culture:

**People-centered approach**: The company always puts people at the center, not only in the work environment but also in extracurricular activities.

**Social responsibility**: TA Consultant is always aware of its responsibility to the community and society.

**Learning spirit**: Each trip brings new experiences, helping everyone develop both personally and professionally.

## Memories That Last Forever

When returning to the office after the trip, the entire team felt like we had been "recharged" with full energy. The stories, laughter, and memories from the trip became motivation for us to work together more effectively.

The developers in the team are now not just colleagues but also close friends. Understanding and trust in each other have been strengthened through each activity, each shared moment.

## The 2k Spirit ‚Äì Youthful Energy & Connection

One of the highlights of the trip was spending time with our **2k team members ‚Äì affectionately nicknamed the "2k"**. These young developers brought a refreshing energy to the group with their open minds, friendly personalities, and ability to connect effortlessly with everyone‚Äîfrom interns to managers.

Their vibrant conversations, spontaneous jokes, and constant curiosity made every bus ride, meal, and activity more lively. Whether discussing the latest frontend trends or simply vibing to music by the beach, the 2K reminded us all of the joy of being present and embracing each moment with enthusiasm.

They didn't just blend in‚Äîthey *brightened up* the entire trip.
